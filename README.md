<h1>AH-6 Little Bird Helicopter Sales Page</h1>
<br>
For this project I wanted to try to build a more equitable website. I had just finished a HTML and CSS course that spent a lot of time focusing on building equitable designs, so I wanted to put what I learned to the test. But, me being who I am, I wasn't satisfied with going the standard route and building out a restaurant website or a hokey product sales page. So instead, I built a sales page for an attack helicopter.

<h1>How It's Made:</h1>
<br>

**Tech Used:** JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
<br>
<p>One of my other goals for this project was to write as much of the HTML and CSS as possible from scratch. For example, I knew I was going to use Bootstrap for the image carousel, so I opted to build the navbar from scratch. I wrote some JavaScript code to turn the navbar buttons darker when they were hovered over. Specifically, I took a long time fiddling with different div/button configurations to get the oppacity just right.</p>
<br>
<p>Aside from that, I spent a lot of time making sure all of the HTML was as accessible as possible. To meet this goal, I made sure all of my code was wrapped in sections and that all of my images had alt tags.</p>
<br>
<p>After I making sure that all of my HTML was as accessible as possible, I moved on to writing all of the JavaScript for the feature viewer carousel thingy (I don't have a fancy name for it lol). Basically, when a viewer clicked a button on either side of a picture of the helicopter, I wanted a little card to appear to show some information about a particular feature. To do this, I wrote a JavaScript function that cycles through an index. Then I created the cards and tied their id's to the index and turned them on and off based on the user clicking the arrows.</p>
<h1>Lessons I Learned</h1>
<br>
<p>My biggest take away from this project was designing for mobile first. I want to stress that this website was not built to be responsive since I was just trying to test out some design principles. However, looking back, I definetly should've take the time to consider how the site would look and function on other screens. Since I didn't prioritize building a design that would function well on all screen sizes, translating the desktop design to mobile would take a considerable ammount of time and work.</p>
<br>
<p>This project was overall just a great way for me to get some more experience writing HTML and CSS. Before working on this project, I had taken a break from writing code, so this was a good way for me to get back into the swing of things in a relatively short time. And at the end of the day, it was a fun project to build, especially considering the subject matter. I hope you had as much fun reading about the helicopter as I did researching it.</p>
